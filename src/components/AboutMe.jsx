                    Iâ€™m a passionate web Developer and Software Engineer with a deep commitment to building elegant, high-performance, and user-centric digital experiences.
                     My expertise lies in crafting scalable cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter, backed by a strong foundation in JavaScript,React and Node.js.

                    I take pride in turning complex challenges into simple, beautiful, and intuitive solutions â€” from responsive UI design to seamless backend integration.
                   Beyond development, I value clean architecture, code reusability, and performance optimization, ensuring that every product I build is robust, maintainable, and future-ready.
                 Iâ€™m continuously exploring modern technologies and best practices to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving industry. Whether working independently or in a collaborative environment, I bring creativity, precision, and strong problem-solving skills to every project I contribute to.
